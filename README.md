# javascript-challenge
 
I used the html starter code that had basic webpage layout including the empty table containers. I used javascript and the powerful d3.select function to select the table body from the html file. Then I created a loop using d3 and Object.entries functions to append the table contents (the keys and values). 

I found the button id in the html code and used the d3 function to activate the button and created the "click" event. I created input variables using the d3 fucntion to allow the user to input a date and then created loop to filter the data by the user's inupt date. 

On the level two assignment, I duplicated the app.js, html, data and css files. First I added the additional list itmes (the labels and inputs): city, state, country, shape containers in the html file. In the app.js file I created input Value and inupt Element variables for date, city, state, country and shape. 

Used if statements to filter data with datetime, city, state, country, & shape equal to input value allowing the user to input one value or multiple values and the output would filter from the information the user input in any or all of the containers.
